# Gemini Conversational Chatbot

This project is a conversational chatbot built using the **Gemini API** for natural language understanding, **Langchain** for managing conversation flow, and **Streamlit** for a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Engage in natural language conversations with accurate and contextually relevant responses.
- **Context-Aware Handling**: Maintains context across interactions to provide coherent replies.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: A web-based interface for immediate and real-time communication.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: The programming language for building the chatbot.
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Powered by the Gemini API.
- **Langchain**: For managing conversation history and flow.
- **Streamlit**: For the front-end web interface.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   
   https://github.com/mohit1899-gif/gemini-conversational-chatbot.git

3. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Make sure you have Python installed. Install all required packages from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up API Key**:  
   The Gemini API key is required for the chatbot to function. By default, the key is read from a `.env` file. If the API key doesn't work, add the key directly in the code instead of using dotenv.

   **Example of adding API key manually in the code**:
   ```python
   import google generative ai

   gemini.api_key = 'your_gemini_api_key_here'
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Streamlit App**:
   Run the following command to start the Streamlit server and access the chatbot:
   ```bash
    py -m streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the Chatbot**:
   The chatbot will be accessible at `http://localhost:8501` (by default), where you can start interacting with it in real time.

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**:  
  If the API key isn't working, ensure that the key is correct and manually add it in the code as described above.
  
- **Dependency Problems**:  
  If there are issues with dependencies, ensure that `pip` is up to date and all required packages are installed.

## Future Enhancements
- Add emotion detection for more personalized responses.
- Save chat history for reviewing past interactions.
- Deploy to cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS for global access.
